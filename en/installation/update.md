# Updating an Isogeo service

The Scan FME application is regularly updated, so you will occasionally have to upgrade an installed Isogeo service so that it will be compatible with the latest upgrades.

The application will notify you if any of your services are no longer compatible, and will prevent you from running any new scans.

To upgrade:

1. Uninstall the existing service.
2. Install the new service.
