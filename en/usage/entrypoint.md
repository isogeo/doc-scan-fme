# Entry points

There are two types of "entry points":

* File: defines paths to directories containing geographic data (on one or more servers; on one or more workstations; subdirectories included/not included), and selects a list of formats to scan;

* Database: defines database connection settings and selects instances to scan.

The GIS administrator can define as many entry points as desired. The scan systematically generates an exhaustive inventory of the data identified for these entry points.
